<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, generally causing respiratory issues. But in extreme cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you believe a mold intrusion, you may wish to invest in a mold screening package to see what kind of mold spores you're working with, and hire a specialist to help with removal. However in the short-term, here are some natural home solutions (made with things you likely currently have on-hand) that will help eradicate mold.</p>
<p>To prevent mold and practice adequate kitchen area maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning.

Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then be sure to dry the location to avoid it from spreading out.</p>
