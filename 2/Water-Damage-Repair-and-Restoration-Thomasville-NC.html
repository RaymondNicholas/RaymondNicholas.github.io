<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is good and damp, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to maintain the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can purchase devices to determine relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to reduce the production of moisture in the home are all extremely essential in controlling high humidity that regularly triggers mold development in our climate.</p>
