Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals right away start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working.

If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
