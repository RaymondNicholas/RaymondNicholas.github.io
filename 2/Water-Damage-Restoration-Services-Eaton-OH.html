If there is a lot of mold development, consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  variations of these and other guidance files are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the moldy material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement might be necessary.<p>
