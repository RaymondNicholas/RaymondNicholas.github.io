<h3>How You Can Benefit From Hiring Fire Damage Restoration Professional in Bridge City</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold specialists usually advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no need to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products soak up water easily. This might intensify the issue due to the fact that as you understand - mold loves moist environments.<p>

The issue is that wood that has been immersed in water has most likely absorbed a large amount of water.
