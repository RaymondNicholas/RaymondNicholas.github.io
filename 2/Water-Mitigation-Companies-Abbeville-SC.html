<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration Companies in Abbeville</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold specialists generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water easily. This might intensify the issue since as you know - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>
