<p>Since common structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
