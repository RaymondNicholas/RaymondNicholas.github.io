Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
