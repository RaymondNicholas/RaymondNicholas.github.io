Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying because the leakage started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
