<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very polite person.</p>
<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Senoia</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold specialists normally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section.
