<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Makawao</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health risk and need to be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
