Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season.
