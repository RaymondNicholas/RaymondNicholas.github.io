<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the area you're fixing so that you understand just how much new wallboard you require. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an energy knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and after that secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel meets. Then apply joint substance over the tape, using a putty knife. Let the compound dry for the time specified by the producer and after that sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper until the joints are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
