<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were fantastic in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the method and also were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
