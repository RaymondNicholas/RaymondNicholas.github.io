<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
