<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his men were amazing in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your home and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Before your home has actually dried, scrub floors and woodwork with a stiff brush, a lot of water, a cleaning agent and disinfectant.
