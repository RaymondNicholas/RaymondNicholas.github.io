<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
