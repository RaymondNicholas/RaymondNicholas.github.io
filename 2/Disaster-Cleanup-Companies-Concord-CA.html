<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Really courteous and easy-going individual.</p>

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
