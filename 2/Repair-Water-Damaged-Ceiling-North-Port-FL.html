<p>Mold in the basement can be relentless, given the nature of basements - they tend to be far more humid than above-ground levels and normally have bad ventilation and little air flow, a combination that can cause mold to thrive. And of course, basements can be prone to flooding, due to severe weather or undetected leakages in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, once mold develops, cinder block or concrete walls can be challenging to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of combustible fuel. When this combustible fuel - carpet, drywall, or furniture - has actually been heated to its special ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and unstable gases will be launched in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause long lasting damage and needs to be dealt with by experienced professionals, heat is the most noticeable, and damaging, product of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - implying that as a fire enters contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
