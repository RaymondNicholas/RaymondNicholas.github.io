<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
