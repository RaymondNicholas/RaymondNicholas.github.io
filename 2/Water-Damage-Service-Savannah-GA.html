<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Eliminate the device from the water as quickly as possible, and eliminate the battery instantly. Getting rid of the battery rapidly might make the difference to conserve your phone.
