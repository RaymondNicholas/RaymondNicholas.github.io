The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid kind. The greater the dew point rises, the higher the amount of moisture in the air.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.</p>
