<p>Since typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
