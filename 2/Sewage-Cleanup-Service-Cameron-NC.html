<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repair work. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges.
