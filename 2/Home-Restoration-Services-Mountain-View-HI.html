<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
