<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same method, so if the location the spores land is wet and good, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially look for any safety risks, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for restricted space entry. We then draw out standing water utilizing our truck-mounted extraction equipment. If your insulation has been impacted, we will remove the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely get rid of it. We will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or finishing that avoids water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them if they have actually been damaged.</p>

The initial and final evaluations of a building struggling with a mold problem are necessary for very first determining all concerns in the structure and then making certain the remediation and prevention were totally comprehensive.
