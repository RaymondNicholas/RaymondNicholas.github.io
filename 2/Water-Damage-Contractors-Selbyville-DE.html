The humidity is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The greater the dew point rises, the higher the amount of moisture in the air.</p>
