<p>SERVPRO of Roanoke County is in your area owned and run, so we belong to this community too. We're currently nearby and all set to assist when you have a flooding or water emergency. We take pride in being a part of the Roanoke neighborhood and wish to do our part in making it the very best it can be. Basic policies won't cover water damage arising from a flood, either; for that, you'll need to purchase extra flood insurance, specifically if you reside in a high-risk area vulnerable to flooding (like Louisiana homeowners).<p>
<p>For this reason, we created a four-step technique that permits us to clean the afflicted area without compromising the rest of your home. We can help bring back the environment in your house and provide long-term treatments that keep mold growth at bay. Set an old box fan or a low-cost brand-new one in a window to aerate the room while working. Throw it out when you're done cleaning, due to the fact that the spores are almost difficult to wipe. Tape plywood or cardboard around the window openings so the spores can't blow back in<p>

Correct cleanup after mold removal is crucial to prevent recontamination. You should seal and immediately dispose of products that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the boots or shoes you used while cleaning, wash your clothing in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
