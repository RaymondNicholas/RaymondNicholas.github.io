<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve browsing a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we initially look for any security dangers, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for confined area entry.

We will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or covering that prevents water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them if they have actually been damaged.</p>
