<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is one of the most destructive things that can happen to an individual or a household. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed rather than being totally changed. If there is minor damage then most of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard may require repairing. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor might require changing and often even the subfloor too. The type of wood floor covering you might have limits the type and figures out of repair work that require to take place. Strong hardwood flooring permits a larger range of alternatives to fix the issue. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for private planks. The very best way to look after a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
