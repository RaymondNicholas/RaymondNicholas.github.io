While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will include browsing a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
