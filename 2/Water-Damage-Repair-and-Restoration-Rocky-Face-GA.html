<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Water damage arises from damaged pipes, obstructed drains, malfunctioning appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends on the nature of the damage. Some water brings contaminants and should be thought about dangerous. Whatever the origin, the prospects for restoration depend mainly on the speed with which your building and personal effects can be dried. Even clean water can produce mildew and other bacterial development if overlooked.</p>
