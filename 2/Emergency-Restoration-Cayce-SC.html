<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Cayce</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health danger and must be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
