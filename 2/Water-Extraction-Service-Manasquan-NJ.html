<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By reducing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
