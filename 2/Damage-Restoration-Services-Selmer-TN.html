These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, throughout numerous days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
