<p>Mold in the basement can be consistent, given the nature of basements - they tend to be far more humid than above-ground levels and normally have poor ventilation and little air flow, a mix that can trigger mold to flourish. And obviously, basements can be vulnerable to flooding, due to severe weather condition or undiscovered leakages in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, when mold establishes, concrete block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Extra Services Offered: Most contractors see the requirement to include or offer additional services. After some time in business, you're missing out on extra dollars to subcontractors.
