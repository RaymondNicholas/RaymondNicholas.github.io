<p>Drying: Once the mold is contained in a room, we continue to clear it out and after that dry off the wetness. For soft, washable products, such as clothing and bedding, first decide if the item is worth keeping. Smoke is difficult to totally eliminate, and you may have more vital things to spend time on. Multiple wash cycles - without letting the products dry in between - might be needed. We'll take care of every detail when it concerns fire and smoke restoration, consisting of the removal of soot, smell, particles, hazardous toxins, water, and fixing structural damage.<p>
<p>Cladosporium: This mold may be green or black. (Though it is black in color, it is not the same as black mold.) It grows on the backs of toilets and painted surfaces and in fiberglass air ducts.

We bring back regular living conditions to get you back to regular as rapidly as possible.
