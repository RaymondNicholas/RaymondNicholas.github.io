The CDC recommends that you wear long pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt, protective gloves and eyeglasses, waterproof boots, and a mask rated at least N-95 or more to safeguard your nose and mouth.

<h3>Fire Restoration in Fort Edward - Fix Your Smoke and Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and must be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
