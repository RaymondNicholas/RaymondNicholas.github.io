<h3>Water Damage Equipment in Oakland California</h2>
<p>We recently had major water damage due to a washing device overflow. Rainbow came out to your home on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and proceeded to take the action necessary to prevent additional damage working late into the night. They also finished the whole dry which took several days and a lot of hard work. Constantly arrived on time and did what they guaranteed and kept me informed of each step. It was a satisfaction to handle the entire group. I would not think twice to suggest them for any work of this nature including mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>Completely shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating option, then spray the affected area so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly throughout this procedure in order to ensure the solution stays well mixed.)

Never scrape dried mold, or else the poisonous spores might spread out into air and cause negative health results.</p>
