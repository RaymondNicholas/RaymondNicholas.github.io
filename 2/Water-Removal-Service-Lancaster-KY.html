There are over 100,000 types of types of mold, but the most typical kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is warm and wet, it begins to germinate and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots begin to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or poisonous gasses are launched as the fungis spreads. Mold in your home can be exceptionally harmful and cause a variety of health issues.
