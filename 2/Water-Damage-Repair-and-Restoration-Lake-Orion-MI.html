<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible indications of wetness, dripping water, or indications of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might collapse or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable plaster product. Other times, you may see small indications like coffee-colored stains that might expand in time.</p>
<p>Because common building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
