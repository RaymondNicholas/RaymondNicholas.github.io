Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground.

Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is good and moist, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
