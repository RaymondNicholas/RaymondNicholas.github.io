<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is one of the most terrible things that can happen to a family or a person. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being totally changed. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require repairing.

The type of wood flooring you might have identifies and limits the type of repairs that need to occur. Strong hardwood flooring permits a broader variety of choices to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area.
