After a heavy rain storm, a fast action is CRITICAL to decreasing prospective secondary damages and costs to your Portland home or organisation. Drying out after water damage need to top any cleanup priority list. Half cup of home chlorine bleach to a gallon of water can be used on nonmetallic, colorfast surfaces as a disinfectant (to eliminate surface mold and bacteria) after cleaning, however it will not prevent new mold growth on materials that stay wet.<p>

For example, some moisture meters identify wetness or water damage in a variety of surface areas, in addition to drawing up wetness damage and reading elevated, normal, or low levels of wetness during drying.<p>
<p>Do not touch or try to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, draperies or other home textile items. Those cleaning actions will only smear soot into the fabric, making cleaning more difficult. Use a dry, absorbent fabric to clean down the phone. Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent fabric. Make sure to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume secrets, the headphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
