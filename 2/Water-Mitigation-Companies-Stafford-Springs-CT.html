<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
