<p>Mold - the look, the odor, even the idea of it makes you recoil. You most likely have visions of long-forgotten takeout food stuffed in the back of your refrigerator, or an old run-down tub that hasn't been used in years. However aside from what may be growing in your refrigerator, family mold is actually very common, and can represent a significant health threat if left untreated. After removing all polluted and damp products, contact someone who can inspect your home and begin the restoration procedure.<p>
<p>A bleach solution also works to kill mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, use to the surface and don't rinse. As home devices get older, their pipelines might begin to crack and rust and their connections or hose pipes can deteriorate as the materials age. Fridges, water heaters, washing dishwaters and makers are all have lots of parts that are susceptible to wear and tear, so keep a mindful watch on older models. The two biggest culprits for water damage in houses are cleaning machines and warm water tanks.<p>
