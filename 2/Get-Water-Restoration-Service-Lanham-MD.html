Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
