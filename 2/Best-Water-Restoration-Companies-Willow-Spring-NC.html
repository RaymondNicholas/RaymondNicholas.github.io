Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying since the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
