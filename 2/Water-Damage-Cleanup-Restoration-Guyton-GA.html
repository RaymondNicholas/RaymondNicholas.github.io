<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
