<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were very practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
