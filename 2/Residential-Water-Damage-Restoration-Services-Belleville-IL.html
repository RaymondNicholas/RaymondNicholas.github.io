<h3>Importance of Hiring Fire Damage Cleanup Specialist in Belleville</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By lowering the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
