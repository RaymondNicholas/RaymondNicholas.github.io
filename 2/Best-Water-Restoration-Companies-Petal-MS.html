<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers.

Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air.

Begin wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always using a clean surface.

If you scrub the spots, you might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>
