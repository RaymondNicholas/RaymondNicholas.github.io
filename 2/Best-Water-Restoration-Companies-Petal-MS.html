Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air.

Begin wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always using a clean surface.

If you scrub the spots, you might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>
