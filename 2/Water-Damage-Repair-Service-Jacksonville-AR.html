<p>A solution of detergent and warm water can be utilized to scrub surface mold off non-porous surface areas. Although detergent itself doesn't eliminate mold, if the mold is on non-porous products then the solution doesn't need to kill it as long as you completely clean away all the mold on the surface. Utilizing a pump sprayer, mist the surface areas with water to control the spread of spores, and roll up the areas. Double-wrap them in. 6-mm plastic and tape them with duct tape for disposal.<p>
