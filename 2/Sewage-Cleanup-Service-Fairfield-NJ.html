<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Fairfield</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repairs, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet.

In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is completed.<p>
