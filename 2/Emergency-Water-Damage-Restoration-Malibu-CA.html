<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his men were remarkable in assisting us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your home and began drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the method and also were very valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>

<p>Attics that aren't well aerated will frequently trap warm, wet air in the cold weather. This can lead 2 to mold impacting the rafters and wall studs.
