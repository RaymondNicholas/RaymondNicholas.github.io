Anything bigger needs to be attached to the ceiling joists in order to firmly hold the patch's weight in addition to any insulation above it.</p>
<p>Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level.

This produces a chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, duct work and circuitry.</p>
