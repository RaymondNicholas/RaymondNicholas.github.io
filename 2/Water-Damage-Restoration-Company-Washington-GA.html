<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling since of a leaky roofing system, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you stress and anxiety and aggravation, particularly if you've never ever done it in the past.

The very best way to avoid mold development is to remove water leaks or wetness in your home. See our short article, How Do I Prevent Mold Growth?" for mold prevention ideas.</p>
<p>Because typical structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
