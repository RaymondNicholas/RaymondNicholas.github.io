<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
