Water damage, water invasion, constructing envelope problems, and construction defects are a very serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing many problems due to dripping doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage.

Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
