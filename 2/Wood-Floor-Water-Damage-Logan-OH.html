<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely harmful. Jake and his men were remarkable in helping us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They fasted to get to your house and began drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the way and also were very useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that involves a substantial quantity of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built up assemblies). Drying may require unique methods, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
