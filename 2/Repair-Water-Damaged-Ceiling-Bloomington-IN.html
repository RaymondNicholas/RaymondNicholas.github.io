The best way to prevent mold growth is to get rid of water leaks or wetness in your house. See our short article, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention tips.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we first look for any safety hazards, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted area entry.
