<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find visible mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>To prevent mold and practice appropriate kitchen maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning.
