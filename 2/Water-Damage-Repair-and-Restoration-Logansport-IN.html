<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

<p>When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and must be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, duct and circuitry.</p>
<p>Damaged locations bigger than 12 square inches might need a complete replacement panel set up due to the fact that big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends on where the damage is located on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out. For example, if the area where you eliminated the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to secure a spot by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you might need to replace the whole drywall panel.</p>
