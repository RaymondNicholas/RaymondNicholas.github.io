<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his men were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were very handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>

<p>The location that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can easily take a trip as soon as they are interrupted. Air filtering systems are normally used in conjunction with the sealing of the area to eliminate as many airborne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to unfavorable air pressure, which prevents the circulation of air between the infected space and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be shut off to avoid the mold from spreading out also.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish to address the use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold development is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Professional Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical level of sensitivities particularly if used in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach disappears effective at removing mold than a damp fabric and a mild cleaning agent, so we suggest the least toxic choice.</p>
