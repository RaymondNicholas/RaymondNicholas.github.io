As soon as MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this deterioration procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>
