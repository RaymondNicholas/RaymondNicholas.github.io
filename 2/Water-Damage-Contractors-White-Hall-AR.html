<p>Because the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it wet can become a significant headache. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag before drying, repairing it may simply require pressing it back into location, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
