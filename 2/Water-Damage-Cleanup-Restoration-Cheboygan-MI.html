<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
