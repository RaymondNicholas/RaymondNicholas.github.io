<p>Since common structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Specific areas of your home such as crawl areas, basements and attics are a lot more susceptible to water damage. Dark, moist crawl spaces can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they flourish. If there is moisture leaking through it, the concrete foundation of your home can cause leaking in the basement. Condensation in the location in between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roof, which can cause mold and decomposing.

<p>Mold is practically everywhere, floating in the air and on all surfaces. People are exposed to molds 24 hr a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.

Leaks from the roofing will make this area damp, which in turn leads 2 to higher than average mold development.
