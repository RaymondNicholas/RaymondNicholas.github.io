<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>After the water and wetness have been removed the next action to fix water damage is to clean and sterilize the impacted areas. Flood water frequently brings sewage and other contaminants with it. These impurities should be eliminated before final repairs are performed. Business cleaners and commercial sanitizers will ensure that your residential or commercial property is effectively cleaned and dealt with.</p>
