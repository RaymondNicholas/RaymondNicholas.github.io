<p>Any structure that has actually experienced water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Wear a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore protection, and cover arms, hands and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the musty area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the occurrence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use business black mold removal products, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the moldy areas, in addition to any surrounding locations. If you utilize bleach, ensure it will not discolor the material or surface.
