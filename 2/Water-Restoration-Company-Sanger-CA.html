<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
