<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Randolph</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repair work. By decreasing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is completed.<p>
