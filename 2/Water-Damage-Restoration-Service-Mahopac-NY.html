When MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>
