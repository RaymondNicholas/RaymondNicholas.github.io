<h3>Water Damage Apartment in Lindenhurst New York</h2>
<p>The location that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can easily take a trip as soon as they are disrupted. Air filtering systems are generally used in conjunction with the sealing of the area to get rid of as many air-borne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, as well as negative atmospheric pressure, which avoids the flow of air in between the polluted area and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be shut off to prevent the mold from spreading out as well.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any adjustments.</p>
