<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, however it can happen by itself if a fire is consisted of. A number of hundred claims submitted in the last five years allege that most of these houses contain lots of offenses of the state-mandated building code that eventually allowed water to drain into both new and renovated houses. Many homes with water damage absence fundamental weatherproofing products, assessment reports say. Coats of stucco are typically too thin. According to a suit by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, workmanship was so poor that, even before the household relocated, a mushroom sprouted in the floorboard of their 20-month-old kid's bedroom.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was a best storm"-- a combination that lawyers now allege came from pressure to develop much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little government and contractor oversight. Contribute to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
