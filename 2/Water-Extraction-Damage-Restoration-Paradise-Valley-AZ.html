You'll want to get rid of mold from the outside of your house, on siding or on your deck, as quickly as possible.

If you were flooded with clean water and it's bone dry within 24 hours, you may be able to conserve your flooring. If not, rip it up. To avoid mold in the bathroom, ensure to open windows if you have them to enhance ventilation and run the fan when showering, shaving or cleaning. Clean water off tough surface areas, like shower walls and sinks, and repair pipes leakages as soon as possible. Scrub mold from surface areas as soon as it appears, then be sure to dry the location to avoid it from spreading out.<p>
