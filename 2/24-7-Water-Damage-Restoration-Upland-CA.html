<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can take place by itself if a fire is contained. Without appropriate cleaning, smoke smell remains in clothing, linens, drapes, pillows, clothing and other soft" products for months or longer. Soot and fire residue spots often can't be eliminated using readily-available household products. IRS Restoration professionals recuperate soft products using the Esporta ES-3300 Wash System Its trademarked, environmentally-friendly washing system safely and completely deep cleans, deodorizes and sterilizes soft contents to return them to pre-fire condition.</p>
<p>A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, causing major water accumulation. Colby and Caleb arrived on the scene within a couple of hours and continued to drain pipes the area before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and set up new insulation in the location. They offered exceptional, efficient, and professional service along with being friendly and pleasant to deal with. I wholeheartedly recommend Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them again must the need develop.</p>
