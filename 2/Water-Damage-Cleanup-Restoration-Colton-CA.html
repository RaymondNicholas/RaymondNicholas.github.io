<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
