Remove all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to eliminate it. They might be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion if drywall panels just show water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised. When cutting out around the damaged location, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
