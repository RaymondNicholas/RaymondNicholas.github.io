<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, because it could accidentally press liquid into the phone's more delicate parts.

Proper cleanup after mold removal is crucial to avoid recontamination. You must seal and immediately dispose of products that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the shoes or boots you wore while cleaning, clean your clothes in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
