<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<h3>Water Damage Inspection Brookings SD 57006</h3>
<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, however a weathered and split chimney can often let in rain during the cooler months which can permeate through the walls. In time, moisture from the water can cause the paint on the wall to peel, flake and bubble. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a worn out and unloved area.<p>
<p>Eliminating among the 3 requirements for mold minimizes (or removes) new mold development: wetness; food for the mold spores (for example, dust or dander ); and warmth since mold generally does not grow in cold environments. I had a fantastic experience working with the group at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were professional, punctual and really communicative!
