Desiccant dehumidifiers - This sort of dehumidifier creates the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers take in wetness through chemical attraction rather of condensation to eliminate water from the air. A desiccant is a product that draws in and holds wetness. This material imitates a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through warmed exhaust air, the wetness vaporizes (desorption) and is brought outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
