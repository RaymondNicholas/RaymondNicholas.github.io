<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>
