Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying because the leakage started, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment.
