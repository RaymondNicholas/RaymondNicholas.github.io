This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
