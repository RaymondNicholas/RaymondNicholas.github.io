<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling because of a leaking roofing system, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can cause you stress and anxiety and irritation, specifically if you have actually never ever done it before. This makes the scenario more unsafe if the flooding in your home contains sewage or was caused by a sewage backup. Sewage frequently consists of pollutants such as germs, viruses, E-Coli, and liver disease that can have drastic health impacts. Our technicians are licensed and insured to eliminate sewage water safely and bring back the affected area. We will thoroughly clean and sanitize the locations polluted by sewage to eliminate the threat of negative health impacts for you, your family, and your staff members and customers.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surfaces begins next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any hard surface areas to remove the mold from the surface area. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furniture, clothing, or toys, these are normally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are eliminated, typically including deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>

Our mold issue ended up being smaller than first believed so the last billing reflected the real work needed and was less than very first estimated. Jake was very responsive to calls and emails answering questions throughout the process. All in all, I had a very good experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>Current Evaluation: A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water accumulation.
