<p>Due to the fact that common building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
