<p>Learn how to get rid of black mold securely and efficiently. When you have water damage and aren't sure right away from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or broken pipes can be a significant headache.

A pipeline burst in the attic can lead to gallons of water drizzling down on the rooms inside your home.</p>

<p>Indoor mold growth can usually be seen or smelled. In most cases, if noticeable mold development is present, sampling is not needed. There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can use to evaluate a mold sampling result. The Florida Department of Health does not advise mold testing or sampling to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what kind of mold might be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be pricey and, if done, need to only be done by skilled professionals. Examine a mold problem; don't test</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each two to three rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, throughout numerous days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
