<h3>Fire Restoration in Scottdale - Fix Your Smoke and Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health hazard and ought to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
