What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
