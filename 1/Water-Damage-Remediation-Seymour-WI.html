<p>Since typical building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
