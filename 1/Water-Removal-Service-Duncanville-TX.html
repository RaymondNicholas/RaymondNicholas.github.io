<h2>Tips For Effective Water Damage Restoration in Duncanville</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
