<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Pleasanton</h3>
<p>Current Review: The three staff members I had contact with were so practical. The techs (Colby and Modo) came to my home to assists with water damage after being off for the day. They had actually gone home for the day but concerned my rescue despite the fact that. Jennifer (the other employee) she was excellent at communicating daily. She always called before coming by. She was versatile and offered me the complete picture of the situation. I liked that she did not rush or push things. The team was considerate, expert, and worked as a team. Colby, Modo, and Jennifer are a must-have in every business.<p>
