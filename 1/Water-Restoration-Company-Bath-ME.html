<p>Protect Non-Damaged Locations- As soon as containment barriers are set up we will begin getting rid of the wet dry wall and start to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which allows the carpet to dry. We will also move furnishings out of the damp locations to guarantee that all excess wetness inside a wall or under a floor is dried, so no mold problems develop later.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other home disinfectants will not eliminate mold. Attempt to keep yourself, kids, staff members and others out of the afflicted location.
