Dead mold can still position health dangers if you are exposed.

<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health danger and need to be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater.

This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
