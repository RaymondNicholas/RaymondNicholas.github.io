<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly devastating. Ultimately, the level of damage will determine whether you need to employ an expert or not. Handling considerable flood or water damage can be a frightening and stressful  time for a homeowner; bringing in an expert can help reduce a great deal of uncertainty.

<p>Prior to your house has actually dried out, scrub floorings and woodwork with a stiff brush, a lot of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by contaminated floodwater must be eliminated and disposed of unless it can be sterilized at a commercial center for an expense significantly less than replacement. Vinyl floor covering and floor tile may need to be eliminated to enable drying of subfloor.</p>

<p>Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level.

This develops a chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, duct work and electrical wiring.</p>

Water intrusion where damp, porous materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent less than ~ 5% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where materials referred to as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have soaked up very little wetness.</p>
