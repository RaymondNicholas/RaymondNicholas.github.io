<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
