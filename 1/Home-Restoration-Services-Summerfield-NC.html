Warm air in between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is perfect, especially for the very first 36 to 2 days of drying and is the optimal temperature for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation process. Excessively hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit hampers the dehumidifiers' effectiveness.<p>
