<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, constructing envelope issues, and building and construction problems are an extremely serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing many concerns due to leaking doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, apartment or condos, condominiums, townhouses, hotels, industrial buildings are especially susceptible to these concerns as generally the contractor farms out the outside envelope work and wall assembly procedure, therefore leading to corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>A pipe burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water build-up. Colby and Caleb showed up on the scene within a couple of hours and proceeded to drain the location before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and set up brand-new insulation in the area. They provided exceptional, effective, and professional service as well as being pleasant and friendly to deal with. I wholeheartedly suggest Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them once again should the need emerge.</p>
