Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a vital part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside your home, mold growth need to be prevented. Mold recreate by methods of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, but unnoticeable to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surface areas.
