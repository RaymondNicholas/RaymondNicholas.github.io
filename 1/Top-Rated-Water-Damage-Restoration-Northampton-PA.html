<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a household or service can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts right away start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
