<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Closter</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
