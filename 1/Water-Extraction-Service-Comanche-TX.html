<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his people were incredible in assisting us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often two times a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were very practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
