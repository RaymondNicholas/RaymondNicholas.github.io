<p>Discover how to remove black mold securely and effectively. When you have water damage and aren't sure right away from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or broken pipelines can be a major headache. Sprinkler line pipeline burst typically goes unnoticed until the water comes hurrying through basement window wells and walls causing significant basement water damage. A pipeline burst in the attic can lead to gallons of water drizzling down on the spaces inside your home.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
