<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show visible indications of moisture, dripping water, or indications of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable gypsum product. Other times, you may notice small indications like coffee-colored discolorations that might expand with time.</p>
