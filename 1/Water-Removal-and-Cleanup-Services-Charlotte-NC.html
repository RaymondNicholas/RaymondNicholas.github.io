<h3>Professional Fire Restoration in Charlotte</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, bear in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By decreasing the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is ended up.<p>
