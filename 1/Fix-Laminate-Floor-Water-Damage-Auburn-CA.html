<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely goes away.

Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
