<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and should be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>Likewise, since bleach is mostly water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly absorbed by the product. So, while you might have wiped off or stained the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact supplied a lot of water to regrow and potentially spread the mold underneath the surface. If there is a great deal of mold growth, speak with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  variations of these and other assistance files are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be required.<p>
