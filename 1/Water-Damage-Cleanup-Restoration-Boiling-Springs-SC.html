Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

If not, you might need to change the whole drywall panel.</p>
