Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out how much water costs I was paying since the leakage started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Really respectful and easy-going person.</p>
