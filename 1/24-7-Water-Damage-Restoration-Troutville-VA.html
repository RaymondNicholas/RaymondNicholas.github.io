<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a household or service can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process.
