<h2>How to Restore Your Garland Home From Flood Damage?</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Before your house has dried, scrub floorings and woodwork with a stiff brush, plenty of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by polluted floodwater must be removed and discarded unless it can be sterilized at an industrial facility for a cost significantly less than replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile may need to be gotten rid of to enable drying of subfloor.</p>
