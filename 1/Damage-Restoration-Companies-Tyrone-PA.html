<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health danger and should be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
