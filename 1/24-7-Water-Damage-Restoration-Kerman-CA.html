A fireplace can provide your living room a sense of warmth and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and broke chimney can typically let in rain during the colder months which can seep through the walls. Gradually, moisture from the water can cause the paint on the wall to bubble, peel and flake. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a exhausted and unloved space.<p>
<p>We can avoid additional damage. Flooding can generate extra problems like structural damage and the growth of mold and mildew. We can hamper this damage with a thorough evaluation of the home, and a proper plan of action on how to entirely dry it out.
