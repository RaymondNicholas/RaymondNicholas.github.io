Begin wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas beneath. Or simply grab a new sponge. Ensure you utilize a cleaning motion the whole time.
