<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at danger of mold development. There is a great video below that I encourage you to watch. We encountered it while assisting a reader with a RV water damage repair. Not just does it do a great task of revealing you the damage that water can do to a RV, the creator also shows how to repair the damage action by action. Now this repair was done in 2011 to a Fleetwood Burglar 275N Fifth-wheel travel trailer, but the principles still use even if you have a motorhome or fiberglass exterior.</p>
<p>The best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the presence of a mold problem needing action and the level of damage then composes a clear scope of work including suitable standards. This file needs to plainly describe the actions that will be followed by the remediation specialist, for example how the affected location will be included or what the verification criteria are. Without a clear contract in composing the conclusions, data, measurements are delegated the analysis of each party.</p>
