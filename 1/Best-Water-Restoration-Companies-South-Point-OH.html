<p>Eliminating one of the 3 requirements for mold lowers (or eliminates) brand-new mold development: moisture; food for the mold spores (for example, dust or dander ); and heat given that mold usually does not grow in cold environments.

<p>After scrubbing the surfaces, enable the bleach solution to continue to penetrate the surface areas and dry. Getting an area dry requires getting rid of the moisture not only from the affected products however also from the air. Fans will blow air throughout the surface area and trigger the water to evaporate, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it will not settle back into the product and trigger further damage to the room.<p>
