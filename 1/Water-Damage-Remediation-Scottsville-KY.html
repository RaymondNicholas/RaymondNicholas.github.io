<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air till they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the location the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>After the water and moisture have been removed the next action to repair water damage is to clean and sanitize the impacted areas. Flood water often brings sewage and other pollutants with it.

<p>Rust is a process, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and gradual wear and tear of materials (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust takes place when you combine electrical energy, metal, water and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal elements generally begin wearing away instantly after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can operate typically for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How fast the rust procedure takes depends upon a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
