<h3>Hardwood Floor Water Damage in Angola Indiana</h2>
<p>When a customer calls with a water damage emergency, our group is prepared to react right away. Immediate water extraction and drying is needed to consist of the extent of the water damage and not run the risk of further damage. Mold becomes a significant risk if water sits too long. The longer a water damage scenario is left unsettled, the more damage happens and the issue will end up being more pricey to repair.</p>

This process soaks up moisture without ice accumulation and is not restricted by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily run listed below freezing temperature levels.</p>
<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a costs for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying because the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite person.</p>
