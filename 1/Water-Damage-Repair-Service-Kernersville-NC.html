Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floors and walls is another possible impact of water damage. Walls and floor covering might require replacement or refinishing depending upon the extent of damage.

Standard household fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate quantity of air required to dry a room properly.</p>
