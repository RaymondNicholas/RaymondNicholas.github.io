<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold professionals usually advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush till the mold disappears.
