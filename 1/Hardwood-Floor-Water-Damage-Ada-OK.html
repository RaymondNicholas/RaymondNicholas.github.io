<h2>Steps to Preventing Water Damage in Ada</h2>

<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Once InstaScope was created, we engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally recognized professional on the biological aspects of air pollution, this group was designated to verify and test the new technology. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial customers that, unlike any other approach or device, can provide scientifically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the threats of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
