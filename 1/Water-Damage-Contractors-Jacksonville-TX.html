<h3>Foundation Water Damage in Jacksonville Texas</h2>
<p>Starting water damage cleanup as soon as possible is very important since water can be soaked up by porous materials, including wood and sheetrock, or seep under the substructure of floors. Initially, we remove excess water, and then continue water damage remediation with professional drying and dehumidifying to avoid mold development. Plus, we use water detection probes to discover covert water damage cleanup issues that might cause mold development, rusted pipes or other issues. Our complete series of water damage remediation services includes repair or replacement of structural elements such as decomposed wood or destroyed drywall, and cleaning or defense of ornamental items or individual contents.</p>
<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a serious health risk. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
