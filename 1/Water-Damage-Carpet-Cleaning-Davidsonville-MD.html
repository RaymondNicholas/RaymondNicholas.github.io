<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
