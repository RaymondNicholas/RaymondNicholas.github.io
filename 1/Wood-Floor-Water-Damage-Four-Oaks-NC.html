<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Search for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, velvety, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper).
