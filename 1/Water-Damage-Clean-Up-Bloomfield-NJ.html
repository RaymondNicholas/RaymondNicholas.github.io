<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. As soon as InstaScope was created, we engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally recognized professional on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was designated to confirm and check the brand-new technology. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to develop a new mold-assessment system for commercial consumers that, unlike any other technique or device, can deliver clinically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly. So when you consider all the threats of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
<p>The very best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the existence of a mold problem requiring action and the degree of damage then composes a clear scope of work including relevant requirements. This file must plainly describe the actions that will be followed by the remediation professional, for instance how the affected location will be included or what the confirmation criteria are. Without a clear contract in composing the conclusions, data, measurements are left to the analysis of each celebration.</p>
