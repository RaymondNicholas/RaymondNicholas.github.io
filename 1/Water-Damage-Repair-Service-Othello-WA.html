<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
