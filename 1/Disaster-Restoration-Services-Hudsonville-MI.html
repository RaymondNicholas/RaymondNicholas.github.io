<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also gives off severe fumes and it even produces harmful gas when blended with ammonia. There are safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce unsafe fumes or leave behind harmful residue. For these factors attempt to avoid using bleach and if you must utilize it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
<h3>Water Extraction in Hudsonville Michigan</h2>
<p>Open doors and windows to eliminate wetness and odors if the weather permits. If the outside humidity becomes greater than within, close things up; likewise, close up the house overnight if temperatures drop and wet air might otherwise be drawn inside your home. If windows are stuck tight, remove window strips and eliminate whole sash. If doors are stuck, drive out door hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then get rid of.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days.
