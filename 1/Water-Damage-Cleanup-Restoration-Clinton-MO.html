<p>Any structure that has actually struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold growth. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on walls and floorings is another possible effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering might need replacement or refinishing depending on the extent of damage. Moldy odors can remain in a home where leaks or flooding have actually occurred and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
