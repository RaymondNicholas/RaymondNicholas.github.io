<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping.

We were really pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done appropriately.
