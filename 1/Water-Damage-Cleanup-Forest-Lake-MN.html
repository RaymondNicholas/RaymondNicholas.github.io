When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to finish the job effectively.
