Often it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

Ceiling drywall panels may droop or crumble under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum product. Other times, you may observe little indications like coffee-colored discolorations that may expand with time.</p>
