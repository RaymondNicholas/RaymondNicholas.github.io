<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge.

This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
