As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
