<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth discovering.
