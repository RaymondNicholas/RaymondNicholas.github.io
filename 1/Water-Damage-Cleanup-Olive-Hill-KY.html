Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
