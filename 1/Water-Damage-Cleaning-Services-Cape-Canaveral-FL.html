<p>One reason is that bleach can not completely kill mold growing in porous products. The chlorine in bleach can not penetrate into permeable surface areas such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface area of porous materials and just the water component of the bleach is taken in into the product, offering more wetness for the mold to feed on. Final Fixes: The final steps of the fire damage restoration project are the conclusion of repair work. Normally, repair work include the replacement of materials, painting, and any other repair services that will be needed to restore the home or service to its pre-loss condition.<p>
