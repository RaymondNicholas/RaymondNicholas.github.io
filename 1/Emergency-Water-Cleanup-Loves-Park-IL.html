<p>Discover how to remove black mold safely and successfully. Category 3 - Category 3 water is grossly polluted and can consist of pathogenic, toxigenic, or other damaging agents. Examples of Classification 3 water can consist of, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that stem from beyond the toilet trap regardless of visible material or color; all kinds of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and increasing water from rivers or streams; and other infected water going into or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from typhoons, tropical storms, or other weather condition related events. Such water sources may carry silt, raw material, pesticides, heavy metals, regulated products, or poisonous organic compounds.</p>
<p>Since tiny mold spores exist naturally almost all over, indoors and outdoors, eliminating all mold from a home or organisation is difficult.
