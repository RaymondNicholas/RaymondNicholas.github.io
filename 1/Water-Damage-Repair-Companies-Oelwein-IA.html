<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
