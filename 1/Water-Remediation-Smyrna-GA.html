<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a severe, destructive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach also provides off severe fumes and it even produces poisonous gas. There are more secure alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce harmful fumes or leave harmful residue. For these factors try to avoid utilizing bleach and if you need to utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
<h3>Damage Restoration in Smyrna Georgia</h2>
<p>Utilizing bleach or other chemicals to eliminate indoor mold development is not required for the most part. The objective should be to remove mold growth by cleaning or getting rid of moldy materials. Dead mold can still present health threats if you are exposed. Using bleach or other disinfectants on surface areas after mold removal may be required where individuals are thought to be prone to fungal infections (such as a person with body immune system issues). Should you decide to use bleach or another chemical, please read and thoroughly follow the label instructions and threat statements (caution, caution, risk). Do not mix bleach with ammonia cleaners or acids, because an unsafe chlorine gas may be formed.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep pictures of the water damage and all files connected with the damage and your claim in case mold grows in the future. Your insurance company may be hesitant to concur that any possible mold is the outcome of previous water damage, but having pictures and records will serve as valuable evidence of your claim. If the mold is deemed to have actually originated from water damage, some insurance companies might make you submit a second claim of water damage instead, requiring you to pay another deductible before remediation occurs.</p>
