<h2>Steps to Preventing Water Damage in Berkeley Heights</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal visible indications of moisture, leaking water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster product. Other times, you might notice small indications like coffee-colored discolorations that might broaden gradually.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we first check for any security threats, following OSHA and COIT rules for confined space entry. We then extract standing water using our truck-mounted extraction devices. If your insulation has been affected, we will get rid of the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely deal with it. If they have actually been damaged, we will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them.</p>
