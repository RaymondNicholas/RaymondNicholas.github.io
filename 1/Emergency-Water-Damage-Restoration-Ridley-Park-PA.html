Possible liability and health concerns from mold can be considerably decreased by doing it right the very first time. Clean up should be comprehensive and instant, following a procedure like the above steps. It may sound over-simplified, but the primary failure in response to homeowner problems is just the truth that builders do not respond quickly enough, or with the focus that the issue is potentially major.</p>
