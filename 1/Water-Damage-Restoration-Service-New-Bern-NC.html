<p>You can also choose to work with a specialist to examine the water damage and provide you a quote for the cost to repair it.

As soon as you have actually agreed on a sensible settlement for the cost of repair work, the insurance company will normally send you an advance of about half the payment to begin repairs and send you the remainder upon completion, minus the deductible.</p>
<p>BRAVO - task well done! Found a flood in your home in San Francisco - water had actually been over streaming a 2nd floor sink for 15 hours. Gotten in touch with Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at your home within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of devices to mitigate the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were put on hardwood walls, floors and ceilings were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Outstanding, professional care.
