<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. We engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado as soon as InstaScope was produced. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide recognized expert on the biological aspects of air pollution, this team was appointed to validate and check the new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for industrial clients that, unlike any other method or device, can provide clinically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
