<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Alvin</h3>
<p>Our IICRC licensed specialists will carry out water extraction, eliminate unsalvageable contents and structures, clean the affected areas, use disinfecting representatives, dry the structure and deodorize. The damage to your residential or commercial property and contents will be thoroughly recorded with photos of the loss before we begin working, throughout the procedure and after our work is completed.

<p>Deodorization: In regards to deodorization, we utilize either ozone machines, which can only be used when the residential or commercial property is completely vacant for a prolonged time, or hydroxyl units. For many years, we have used hydroxyl units increasingly more on our fire and smoke jobs. These units can be used while work is being completed without any damage to service technicians or locals. We set these systems up on the first day and allow them to run for the entire project. Often, the unit will be set closest to the reason for the fire to be most reliable.<p>
