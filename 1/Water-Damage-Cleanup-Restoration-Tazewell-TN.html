<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal visible signs of moisture, dripping water, or indications of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may sag or fall apart under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum product. Other times, you may discover little signs like coffee-colored discolorations that may expand gradually.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice adequate kitchen area maintenance, open windows to enhance ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Clean water from difficult surfaces, and repair leaky faucets as soon as possible. Always make certain your tableware and serving dishes are dry prior to keeping them to keep mold from multiplying in cabinets. Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then make sure to dry the location to prevent it from spreading out.</p>

After a couple of weeks of whitening, there is still a big possibility that the mold will come back.</p>
