<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts generally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush up until the mold vanishes. There's no need to wash it off because borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products take in water easily. This could exacerbate the problem due to the fact that as you know - mold loves wet environments.<p>
