<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at danger of mold development. Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore security, and cover arms, hands and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the moldy location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will lower the occurrence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the moldy locations, in addition to any adjacent locations. If you use bleach, ensure it will not blemish the material or surface area. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials utilized in cleaning in a strong garbage bag, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a neighboring exit instead of the primary house, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
