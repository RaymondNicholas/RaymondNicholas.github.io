<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a severe, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also emits extreme fumes and it even produces poisonous gas when combined with ammonia.

<p>Regrettably, however, utilizing bleach is only efficient if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, tubs, glass and countertops.

Utilizing bleach on these materials will eliminate the mold above the surface however the roots within the material will remain and the mold will quickly return.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers.

Part of our tracking process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days.
