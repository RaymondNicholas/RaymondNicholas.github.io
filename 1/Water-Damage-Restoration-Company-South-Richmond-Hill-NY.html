<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

Not just will these mold parts move through your home in locations such as the floor, rafters or the ceiling, they can also cause conditions such as asthma, coughing or skin irritation.</p>
<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly attempts to reach stability. Determining the dew point is necessary in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The humidity constantly occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas type. Water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The greater the humidity increases, the greater the quantity of wetness in the air.</p>
