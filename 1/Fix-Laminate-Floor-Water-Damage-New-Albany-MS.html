Drywall and other types of wall products generally do not dry very well, so if your walls are soaked, it's usually best to rip them out to prevent mold, particularly if they aren't absolutely dry within two days. Like bleach, ammonia will kill mold on tough non-porous surface areas such as countertops, glass or tiles however it is inefficient at eliminating mold growing in permeable material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>Once the residential or commercial property is dry, we will clean the soot from surface areas, such as ceilings, products, walls, and floors using customized equipment.
