Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve.
