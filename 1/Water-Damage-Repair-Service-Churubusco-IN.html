<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same method, so if the location the spores land is moist and good, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores.

Sometimes, an encapsulating representative might be needed to cover the stain and any staying spores.</p>
