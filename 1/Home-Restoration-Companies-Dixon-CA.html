<p>BRAVO - task well done! Found a flood in the house in San Francisco - water had been over flowing a 2nd floor sink for 15 hours.

Drying fans were set up, heating pads were placed on hardwood ceilings, floorings and walls were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Outstanding, professional care. Very pleased with their quick shipment of emergency service AND their attention to detail to make sure the water damage was dried entirely.</p>
