<p>Fire is the outcome of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of flammable fuel. When this flammable fuel - carpet, furnishings, or drywall - has been heated to its unique ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and unpredictable gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger long lasting damage and needs to be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most obvious, and harmful, item of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire enters into contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
