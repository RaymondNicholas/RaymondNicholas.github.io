<p>When you are planning large repair work, bear in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges.
