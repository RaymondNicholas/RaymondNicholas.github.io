<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a moist towel. As with a few of the above approaches, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working all right. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, triggering major water build-up. Colby and Caleb arrived on the scene within a couple of hours and proceeded to drain the location before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and set up brand-new insulation in the area. They offered exceptional, efficient, and professional service along with being friendly and enjoyable to work with. I wholeheartedly advise Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them again must the requirement arise.</p>
