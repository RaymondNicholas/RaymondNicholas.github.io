<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
