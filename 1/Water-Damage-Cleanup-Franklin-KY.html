<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Very courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
