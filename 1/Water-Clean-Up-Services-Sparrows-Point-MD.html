<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or approaches will be the most efficient. It is imperative to determine if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and practical energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building products and how they react to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the much faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we first look for any safety risks, following OSHA and COIT rules for confined area entry.
